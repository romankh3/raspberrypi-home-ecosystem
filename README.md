# Smart home based on Raspberry Pi
Build your own smart home ecosystem based on Raspberry Pi. Use the guideline and/or bash scripts, which is tested and verified on real hardware and software.

Why do you need it? It a great chance to build own smart home, which is customing as you want and all the features as you want.

## Base congifuration for the single-board computers
[Full description](BASE_CONFIGURATION.md) [:arrow_up:](#smart-home-based-on-raspberry-pi) Go Top.
  1. Download [Raspbian OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). All the guidelines describe the case with *Raspbian Stretch Lite*, the image with the only command line.
  2. Get microSD card on 16GB+. I prefer SanDisk 16GB.
  3. Format microSD card to FAT32 format. I use *CD Card Formatter* on MacOS.
  4. Install downloaded image on microSD. I use *balenaEtcher* to do it.

## Main server based on Raspberry Pi Modeb 3b+
[:arrow_up:](#smart-home-based-on-raspberry-pi) 
1. Implement [Base Configuration](#base-congifuration-for-the-single-board-computers)
2. Install torrent-downloader(to be added)
3. Mount USB-storage
4. Install own cloud
5. to be added
## Camera monitoring based on Raspberry Pi Zero W
[:arrow_up:](#smart-home-based-on-raspberry-pi)
1. Implement [Base Configuration](#base-congifuration-for-the-single-board-computers)
2. Install MotionEye using next [guidelines](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/wiki/Install-On-Raspbian) or use our bash script `./srcripts/zerow/motion-eye.sh`
3. This raspberry can be used for other needs, too. On demand can be chosen features from list.
## Monitoring home state with different sensors
[:arrow_up:](#smart-home-based-on-raspberry-pi)
In a nutshell:
* CO2 Sensor
* Humidity sensor
* air temperature sensor
* etc

## Local internet customising based on Orange Pi R1
[:arrow_up:](#smart-home-based-on-raspberry-pi) To be added

# Usage
[:arrow_up:](#smart-home-based-on-raspberry-pi)
Step by step these guidelines can be used for creating own smart home ecosystem.

You can use two ways to do it. 
* First is to go step by step throws the description.
* Second is to run bash scripts, which are based on the guidelines.
